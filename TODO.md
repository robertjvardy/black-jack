### Authentication

- on seat assign create a jwt (currently implemented with uuid)
- jwt is assigned to the player obj
- jwt is then sent to the client
- client stores it in local storage

- implement the following:
  - add the jwt to a header in all subsequent requests
  - on the api, restrict calls based on presence of jwt for the seat
  - be sure to clear the local storage and emit to the server to free up the seat if the user closes the browser
